        "1. A bedrock of [psychophysics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452214004369) – the quantitative study of behavior, particularly as it relates to perception – is the use of tasks that require binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no responses). For these experiments, each trial that uses the same task configuration represents a Bernoulli trial. A [psychometric function](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03194552) describes the (typically sigmoid-shaped) relationship between the probability of success (*p*) associated with the Bernoulli distribution for each task condition and the value of the systematically varied independent variable (e.g., stimulus strength for a detection task). A good overview of the kinds of binary choice trials used in psychophysical tasks is in Box 1 of [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2011.00125/full).\n",

Thus, at any given instant of time, you can think of the spiking output of a neuron as the outcome of a Bernoulli trial: a success (spike) or failure (no spike). However, we rarely, if ever, care about whether or not a spike occurred at just a single moment. Instead, we are concerned with longer intervals, which are better analyzed using binomial and Poisson distributions, as detailed [here](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/poisson.pdf)."
